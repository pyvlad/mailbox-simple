## Simple Mailbox

A learning exercise to build a mailbox with React.

View at github pages:
https://pyvlad.github.io/mailbox-simple/

In this project, I am trying to keep things as simple as possible to practice 'bare minimum' React:
- not using 'create-react-app' or another pre-configured environment;
- project setup, babel and webpack configuration are done from scratch;
- using only plain CSS (made local to components via 'CSS-modules') and HTML without any styling frameworks.
